Overview
========
The Simple PWM Interrupt project is to demonstrate usage of the SDK CTimer driver as a PWM with interrupt callback functions
In this example an IO pin connected to the LED is used as a PWM output line to generate a PWM signal.
With an interrupt callback the PWM duty cycle is changed frequently in such a way that the LED brightness can be varied.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.60.1
- Keil MDK  5.39.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
P0_10(J2-4) connect to CTimer simple PWM.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J17) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows example output of the CTimer simple PWM demo using interrupts in the terminal window:
