Overview
========
The Secure Faults demo application demonstrates handling of different secure faults. This application is based 
on application Hello World. In addition, user can invoke different secure faults by setting testCaseNumber variable (see source code).
The following faults can be invoked:

TEST 0: No any secure fault
TEST 1: Invalid transition from secure to normal world
TEST 2: Invalid entry point from normal to secure world
TEST 3: Invalid data access from normal world, example 1
TEST 4: Invalid input parameters in entry function
TEST 5: Invalid data access from normal world, example 2


SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.16.000

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.60.1
- Keil MDK  5.39.0
- GCC ARM Embedded  13.2.1

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXN947 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
Note: MCUXpresso IDE project default debug console is semihost
1.  Connect a type-c USB cable between the PC host and the MCU-Link USB port (J17) on the board
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings (See Appendix A in Getting started guide for description how to determine serial port number):
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Use secure project to download the program to target board
    For IAR environment go to project options/Debugger/Images. Open file dialog for first extra image. Select file hello_world_ns.out and click on open button. 
    Now you have absolute path in the path box. The flash loader requires absolute path to this file.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the hello world demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hello from secure world!
Entering normal world.
Welcome in normal world!
This is a text printed from normal world!
Comparing two string as a callback to normal world
String 1: Test1
String 2: Test2
Both strings are not equal!                              
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case some secure error is raised, the information about error will be printed in the terminal window.

TrustZone Application Development in SDK
Every TrustZone based application consists of two independent parts - secure part/project and non-secure part/project.

The secure project is stored in <application_name>\<application_name>_s directory.
The non-secure project is stored in <application_name>\<application_name>_ns directory. 

The secure projects always contains TrustZone configuration and it is executed after device RESET. The secure project usually
ends by jump to non-secure application/project.
If IDE allows the two projects in single workspace, the user can also find the project with <application_name>.
This project contains both secure and non-secure projects in one workspace (Keil MDK, IAR) and it allows to user easy transition from
one to another project.

Project Structure
The all TrustZone files related to TrustZone are located in trustzone virtual directory. The files are:

- tzm_config.c
- tzm_config.h
- veneer_table.c
- veneer_table.h

File tzm_config.c, tzm_config.h
This file is used by secure project only. It contains one function BOARD_InitTrustZone(), which configures complete TrustZone
environment. It includes SAU, MPU's, AHB secure controller and some TrustZone related registers from System Control Block.
This function is called from SystemInitHook() function, it means during system initialization.

File veneer_table.c, veneer_table.h
This file defines all secure functions (secure entry functions) exported to normal world. This file is located in secure
project only. While header file is used by both secure and non-secure projects. The secure entry functions usually contain
validation of all input parameters in order to avoid any data leak from secure world.

The files veneer_table.h and <application_name>_s_import_lib.o or <application_name>_s_CMSE_lib.o create the connection
between secure and non-secure projects. The library file is generated by linker during compilation of secure project and
it is linked to the non-secure project as any other library.

TrustZone application compilation
As first compile secure project since CMSE library is needed for compilation of non-secure project. 
After successful compilation of secure project, compile non-secure project.

TrustZone application debugging
- Download both output file into device memory
- Start execution of secure project since secure project is going to be executed after device RESET.

If IDE (Keil MDK, IAR) allows to manage download both output files as single download, the secure project
is configured to download both secure and non-secure output files so debugging can be fully managed
from secure project.

Device header file and secure/non-secure access to the peripherals
Both secure and non-secure project uses identical device header file. The access to secure and non-secure aliases for all peripherals
is managed using compiler macro __ARM_FEATURE_CMSE.

For secure project using <PERIPH_BASE> means access through secure alias (address bit A28=1), 
using <PERIPH_BASE>_NS means access through non-secure alias(address bit A28=0)
For non-secure project using <PERIPH_BASE> means access through non-secure alias (address bit A28=0). 
The non-secure project doesn't have access to secure memory or peripherals regions so the secure access is not defined.
